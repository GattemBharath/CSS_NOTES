      Ok, so when using “position: absolute,” the block moves relative to the
      browser window. And when the block moves, it doesn’t leave the space
      behind. That’s why the block moves up to take the green block’s old
      location. And when using “position: relative,” the block moves relative to
      its original position. And when it moves, it leaves the space behind so
      the blue block cannot take the green block’s old location.

      Interaction between blocks with “position: relative” and “position:
      absolute.” So, let’s say in HTML we have a block with class P and a block
      with class Q, which is inside of the block P. Block P is orange, block Q
      is green. And let’s set “position: relative” for block P, and let’s add
      “left: 70px” and “top: 40px.” So, what’s going to happen? Right – because
      we set position: relative, our block including all its content (that is
      including block Q) it’s going to be moved from its original position by
      70px to the right and by 40px to the bottom. So this comes as no surprise.
      Now let’s specify the following for block Q: position: absolute, left:
      70px and top: 40px. So what’s going to happen now? Well, in this case our
      block Q is going to be moved by 70 to the right and by 40 to the bottom,
      but now it’s going to be moved from the edge of block Q (while in the
      previous case it was moved from the edge of the browser window). Now, why
      is that so? Well, because we specified “position: relative” for block P,
      and block P is an ancestor for block Q. This is a distinctive feature of
      how blocks with “position: relative” and “position: absolute” interact
      with each other (it is if absolute is inside of relative). So, remember:
      if we set “position: absolute” for a block and move it using “left” and
      “top,” this block will look for the closest parent block with “position:
      relative.” If there is such a block, it will use this block as the edge
      from which to move. And if it fails to find a parent block that has
      “position: relative,” it will move from the edge of the browser window.
      But “position: fixed” always moves from the edge of the browser window.
